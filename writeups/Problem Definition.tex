\section{Definition}

Magic the Gathering consists of a finite set \(C\) of distinct cards.
\(C\) can be partitioned into sets \(S_1, S_2, ..., S_n\) of \(C\), each called a Magic the Gathering "set".
\(C\) can also be partitioned into two sets \(L\) and \(L_0\), where \(L\) are "basic lands" and \(L_0\) are not.

In a limited, sealed-deck tournament style,
a set \(S\) is chosen and used for play.

Each participant is provided with 6 booster packs consisting of \(15\) cards, totaling to \(90\) cards.
These cards \(B\) are a multiset whose elements are in \(S\).
Participants are also provided with an infinite mutliset \(B_L\) whose elements are in \(L\).

Participants must select a multiset \(D \subseteq B \cup B_L\), \(|D| \ge 40\).

We want to find \(D\) such that we maximize \(P\left(game success | D\right)\).
